                Sanskriti School is a service oriented, non-profit organization, with the spouse of the serving Cabinet Secretary as its chairperson.

The Mission of the School is to provide the right inputs to help the children grow up into caring and sharing individuals, equipped to make the right choices in life and grow up to be responsible citizens of the country and the world.

The school's motto 'Knowledge is Liberation' is the cornerstone around which the character and personality of every child is built. The Society visualises an educational system based on the four basic tenets : universal values, excellence in all things, global understanding by viewing diversity as an asset, and service to humanity.

Rabindranath Tagore

At Sanskriti we are committed to providing a safe and secure learning environment to enable our children to develop skills that will help them be caring, confident and responsible global citizens. As Principal of Sanskriti I believe in the power of the young mind to make a change. It is with this belief and faith that we endeavor to inculcate in our children values of empathy, responsibility, humility and the passion to believe in their dreams.
